# Keyword Research


## My Rules

This is a small set of rules I've created for doing keyword research when deciding on a topic to write and the keywords to use in the blog post.

- Between 2,000 and 5,000 monthly searches
- "Low" competition
- Small articles are okay

**Notes**

Many of my current keywords don't have enough traffic to show up

| scp recursive folder | 3    | 260     | Low         |

**Notes**

This seems to be a long-tail situation. There are lots of scp terms pointing to this page. Because there are numbers, this might be the model to follow for research rather than luck.

**Notes**

Seems like I just got lucky with this page. There are not a lot of keywords pointing at it and those keywords have almost no volume. Still, 71% of traffic comes from Google. This is another long-tail story.
