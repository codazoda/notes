# Mac Workarounds

This is a list of workarounds I sometimes need to use to get things working on my Mac (MacBook Pro 15-inch, 2016) again.

## No Headphone Audio

When the headphones are connected the sound turns off but sometimes it does not come from my analog headphones. One 
theory is that this is caused by the headphone port being in digital mode and refusing to change to analog. First, make 
sure that the *output* setting in *system preferences, sound* is set to *headphones*.

- Continue to play some audio (a video or itunes)
- Connect and disconnect the headphones 3, 4, or 5 times
- Listen for headphone audio
